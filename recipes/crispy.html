    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A healthier way to make tostadas and better tasting. The simple secret to making crispy tostadas is baking the
        corn tortillas instead of frying. </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>6 corn tortillas </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>2 cups refried beans </li>
        <li>2 cups shredded lettuce, or as desired </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to prepare </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix garlic salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and black pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Brush oil over both sides of tortillas and arrange on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake tortillas in preheated oven until crisped on top, about 5 minutes. Flip tortillas and continue baking
            until other side crisps, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Heat refried beans in a saucepan over medium-low, stirring regularly until hot, about 5 minutes (see Cook's
            Note).</li>
        <li>Divide refried beans between tostadas and spread over one side of each; spoon ground beef mixture over the
            beans. Top each tostada with lettuce, Cheddar cheese, and diced tomato.</li>
      
    </ol>
